					<h3>I'm a fun loving, laid-back guy who wants to change the world, one line of code at a time!</h3>
					<img src="Images/computers.png"/>
					<p>I'm originally from the Boston area, but I have lived in Boulder, CO for the last 6 years and I'm very happy to live in this great state. I moved here partially because I wanted to experience a different part of the country after growing up and going to college in the Northeast, but also to find healing in nature. It's important to me to get lost in the woods every once in awhile, and I particularly enjoy taking photographs while doing so. The natural world is filled with peace, wonder, and joy, and helps me feel connected as part of the beautiful dance of life!</p>
					<br>
					<p>I come from a wonderful family who raised me to be kind and respect people from all walks of life. My parents are divorced, but I have loving and affectionate relationships with both of them. I have a younger sister who went to college at CU Boulder. She is one of the reasons I moved out here, and she is one of my best friends. Currently, most of my family lives in Massachusetts, though my sister is considering moving back here to Colorado.</p>
					<br>
					<p>I have led a life filled with twists and turns, some expected and some completely unexpected. In high school and at the start of college, I wanted to be a businessman and an expert in economics. I never would have guessed that I would end up wanting to become a computer programmer, though the seeds of that desire were always lurking in the background.</p>
					<br>
					<p>Computers have been a big part of my life since I was a child, and I used to be an avid gamer (back when computer games bore little resemblance to the complex creations of today). I still love gaming, but now I spend most of my time working on code, practicing yoga, lifting weights, exploring the great outdoors, or relaxing and watching sports.</p>
